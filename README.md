The ToDoList MediaWiki extension provides an ability to add checkboxes to wiki pages. The checkboxes states are stored in wikitext, and they can be checked or unchecked in "read" mode.

The extension is not currently very stable, so I suggest to refresh your page after modification to be sure all your edits (check and uncheck items) are in place.

# Usage 
To insert a checkbox, you can either insert "<todo/>" tag or go to Visual Editor, Insert->Checkbox:

After that you can even copy-paste (Ctr+C & Ctrl+V) to speedup inserting checkboxes. 

To change checkbox state, save page and in "read" mode check on a checkbox.

It will create a page edit event, you can later see it in history:
